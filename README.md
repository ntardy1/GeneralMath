This is a repository for scripts involving general concepts of mathematics, but that don't quite deserve an entire repository on their own.

# ShanksBot
The ShanksBot.py file is a python script that takes a prime number as input and returns the period of the decimal representation of the reciprocal of that prime. Here's some [more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocals_of_primes) on this concept. The 'primes-to-100.txt' file is the text file that the ShanksBot.py file uses when selecting a random prime number. Currently, the ShanksBot.py file has only adequate accuracy. Occasionally, it will say that the period of the reciprocal is two when it is actually something else. This is a bias of the program that is a result of the way it's written.
